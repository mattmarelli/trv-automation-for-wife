This project was really just to help build a broken tool my wife has at her work.
If you want to see what it can do the executable can be downloaded in the dist directory as well as the brk.txt and trv.txt files which can be used as input.
The brk.txt and trv.txt files are sample files and not complete so the output will be missing a lot of rows of information leading to a lot of N/A values in the output excel file that is created.

If you do decided to open the executable you can name the local station, remote station, and breaker names what ever you like.
The breaker interrupting rating should be set to 80 for the data set provided.
The IEEE breaker TRV voltace class should be selected as 245 as well for the data set provided.
Then for the file selects select the trv.txt file for the input saying to select a TRV file.
For the input saying to select a BRK file select the brk.txt file.
Then click run automation and in the directory that the executable program lives will be an excel file output.

This program is not really useful for anyone except my wife and helping her automate her work.
